# DSA-HW02-SparseMatrix

## Overview

A Node.js CLI tool for performing operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) on sparse matrices stored in a simple text file format. Designed for educational use in Data Structures & Algorithms coursework.

## Features

- Loads sparse matrices from custom text files
- Efficient storage using JavaScript `Map`
- Supports matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication
- Saves results to file in the same format
- Command-line interface for interactive use
- Robust error handling for file format and dimension mismatches

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hamse-ai/DSA-HW02-SparseMatrix.git
    cd DSA-HW02-SparseMatrix
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install readline-sync
    ```

## Usage

Run the CLI with Node.js:

```bash
node code/src/sparse_matrix.js
```

You will be prompted to:
- Choose an operation: Add, Subtract, or Multiply
- Enter paths for the two input matrix files
- Enter a path for the output file

### Example Matrix File Format

```
rows=3
cols=3
(0, 1, 5)
(2, 2, 8)
```

- First two lines specify dimensions.
- Each subsequent line: `(row, col, value)` (omit zeros).

### Example Session

```
Sparse Matrix Operations
Choose operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
Enter choice (1-3): 2
First matrix path: ./mat1.txt
Second matrix path: ./mat2.txt
Output file path: ./result.txt
Operation successful! Result saved to ./result.txt
Result dimensions: 3x3
Non-zero entries: 4
```

## File Structure

- `code/src/sparse_matrix.js` â€” Main CLI and sparse matrix logic

## Notes

- All three operations (add, subtract, multiply) are implemented.
- Input files must match the specified format or errors will be thrown.
- For large matrices, further optimizations are possible but not required for coursework.

## Testing

> No automated tests are included yet. For best results, test manually with a variety of input files, including edge cases (zero matrices, mismatched dimensions, empty files, etc.).
